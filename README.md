This is the very first course project that I started to learn distributed computing. It's simplify version to emulate the tman topology management. (The paper “T-Man: Fast Gossip-based Constructions of Large-Scale Overlay Topologies” by Mark Jelasity and Ozalp Babaoglu). This algorithm is also known as Jelasity and Babaoglu’s algorithm.

In this algorithm, every node in the network maintains a list of neighbors. During the network-initialization phase, each node randomly selects k neighbors and places them into its neighbor list. During the network-evolution phase, in each cycle of the iterative algorithm, every node randomly selects one of its neighbors, and then sends a list consisting of the identifiers of its neighbors and of itself to that neighbor. The selected neighbor also sends its neighbors list back to the node which initiated the action. Upon receiving the new neighbor list, the nodes select the nearest k nodes from both the new and old lists as their neighbors and discard all the others.
